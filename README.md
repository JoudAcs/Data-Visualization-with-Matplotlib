# Data Visualization with Matplotlib in Python

This project demonstrates how to create and customize different types of charts using the **Matplotlib** library in Python. The code showcases examples of line charts and subplots to visualize data effectively.

## Features

- **Single Line Chart**  
  A basic line chart with labeled axes and a legend.

- **Dual Line Chart**  
  A comparison of two datasets on the same chart with different styles and labels.

- **Multiple Subplots**  
  A layout with three subplots, each displaying different datasets with titles and axis labels.

- **Customization**  
  Use of markers, line styles, and colors to enhance chart readability and aesthetics.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
## Usage
1. Copy the code into a Python script file (e.g., data_visualization.py).
2. Run the script using the following command:
- python data_visualization.py
3. The program will generate three sets of visualizations:
- A single line chart.
- A chart comparing two datasets.
- A series of three subplots with unique data.

## Output
- Single Line Chart
- Dual Line Chart
- Multiple Subplots

## Customization
You can modify the datasets (x, y, and y2) or adjust the styles (e.g., marker, linestyle, linewidth, etc.) to create personalized visualizations. For example:

- Change the x, y, or y2 arrays with your own data.
- Modify the line style with parameters like '-', '--', '-.', ':'.
- Adjust the marker style to add points on the lines (e.g., o, ^, s).
